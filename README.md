# Proxy-js
A simple node js proxy I made for my laptop just cause I didn't wanted to see vpn ads on google/youtube whole day.
***
## How to run?
```
git clone https://github.com/AdityaXJha/Proxy-js
```
```js
npm install
npm start
```
### It should start running on localhost:3000
****
> Make sure you have nodejs installed
